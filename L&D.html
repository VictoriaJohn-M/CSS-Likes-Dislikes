    <h1>My Likes</h1>
    <p id="First">
        There are quite a number of things that falls into my list of likes, some of them I can't even remember,
        others I don't even know, they just show up, however, these <em>simplicities of everyday living</em> are what paints my day
        with fulfiling joy, no matter how stressed it may seem.
    </p>
    <p><i>Here's a list of some things I like:</i></p>
    <ol class="List" >
        <li>Going for walks</li>
        <li>Listening to Classical Music or any cool sound</li>
        <li>Spending quality time with my family</li>
        <li>Eating well</li>
        <li> <span class="class1">Taking out time to have sweet talks with God</span></li>
    </ol>
<p></p>
<h1>My Dislikes</h1>
<p id="First">I do not like some things at all, it's actually part of what makes me a human, 
    like the <em>yin-yang of walking this planet Earth</em>, and some times I have little or no control over them</p>
    <p><i>Some of them are:</i></p>
    <ul class="List">
        <li>A task spontaneously dropped on my desk</li>
        <li>Being yelled on unnecessarily,<span class="class1"> especially on Mondays</span></li>
        <li>Seeing Children in pain</li>
        <li>Seeing a loved one cry</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p id="First" ><strong>There are so many things I like and dislike, but I'm discoverng that these things, though sometimes <span class="class1">unavoidable</span> 
    make up the simple, beautiful things of everyday living.</strong></p>
